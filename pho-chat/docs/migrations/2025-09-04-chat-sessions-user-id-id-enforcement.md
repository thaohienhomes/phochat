# Migration: Enforce Convex `chat_sessions.user_id` to be a strict `Id<"users">`

Date: 2025-09-04
Author: Augment Agent

## Summary
- Schema tightened so `chat_sessions.user_id` is now strictly `v.id("users")`.
- Prevents future invalid sessions from being created with arbitrary string user IDs.
- A one-off cleaner and a verification query are available under `convex/functions/migrations.ts`.

## Files changed
- `convex/schema.ts`
  - Before: `user_id: v.union(v.id("users"), v.string())`
  - After:  `user_id: v.id("users")`

## Verify the deployment
- Run a quick schema check and (dev) deploy:
  - `npx convex dev --once`

## Identify invalid sessions (pre- or post-cleanup)
- Function: `functions/migrations:listInvalidChatSessions`
- Args: `{}`
- Output example:
  ```json
  { "count": 0, "invalid": [] }
  ```

## Clean up legacy/invalid sessions
- Function: `functions/migrations:cleanChatSessions`
- Args: `{ "dryRun": true }` first to preview, then `{ "dryRun": false }` to apply.
- Behavior:
  - If a string `user_id` matches a `users` document via either `by_clerk` or `by_token`, the session is patched with the correct `Id<"users">`.
  - Otherwise, the session is deleted (cannot be associated to a known user).

## Postâ€‘migration sanity check
- Try to create a chat session with a non-`Id` string `user_id`. It should now fail schema validation.
- Re-run `listInvalidChatSessions` and ensure `count === 0`.

## Notes
- `subscriptions` and `payments` continue to key by external Clerk user ID (string) as before.
- If additional legacy writes surface later, re-run the two migration functions above.
